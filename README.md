This is basically a browser I made in an hour without any chromium or stuff. Expect bugs because I made it in an hour but I don't know if any are there. And the history.json is there because I was messing around with something I might add

This browser does not contain any google stuff so yeah, though I might be wrong because they own far too much. This browser is also pretty private for most people, and I am fine if you want to customize it just, please give me credit if you are going to upload it.

I will probably update this if anyone wants, heavydutyshelf on Discord if anyone wanted that too. ;(

Dependencies if you are going to use the python file:
pip install PyQt5 PyQtWebEngine
