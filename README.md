This is just a simple browser I work on when I'm boredâ€”though I still actively develop it. It has a decent somewhat working ad blocker and contains very little of google more of just a lot of code.

The H.264 and media support system is still a work in progress, mainly because the whole project is built as a single Python file. Despite that, the performance isn't too bad in my opinion. That said, I do plan to optimize it further, as well as trying to improve the ad and redirect blockers, and add more features over time.
